        <p>Hello, I am a first-year undergraduate at the University of Waterloo in Software Engineering. I started to develop a strong interest in software ever since I became attached to Linux. I found it fascinating to be able to able to tweak with programs and piece them together to make something more complex and powerful. I continue to find joy in programming as I make useful, innovative, and extensible software for the community to utilize.</p>
